# YokaiWatchMedals

An Android app that displays Japanese Yo-kai Watch medals and products.

It's a work in progress, a kind of sandbox for my experimentations with Android.

Features:

Displays lists of the Japanese versions of the collectible medals from the Japanese licence Yo-kai Watch.

Also displays the products in which each medal can be found.

Also displays the characters featured of the medals.

Sorting according to different criteria, smooth animation, search.

Local SQLite database copied from the assets in the apk, then updated when launching the app if an update is available.

The LQ and HQ images will be downloaded at the first run of the application and then updated if newer versions are available online (not initially in the apk due to copyright issues).

Dowloaded contents are hosted on our website https://yokaiwatchworld.net/.

Several languages available : English, French, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Japanese (romaji), German, Korean (?).

Future features:
Collection management.


An older version of this app was available on our website https://yokaiwatchworld.net/ . It had many other features but was badly written.
